**Marking rubric**
Step 1 – [2 points]: Sepia filter has been implemented successfully and images look very similar to the ones provided by the instructor.

Step 2 – [2 points]: Vignetting has been achieved using the map() and constrain() functions (code check required) and results look very similar to the ones provided by the instructor.

Step 3 – [3 points]: Radial blur has been achieved using the map() and constrain() functions (code check required). Clicking on the face of the boy in the colour image replicates the results provided by the instructor.

Step 4 – [2 points]: Borders recreated using the technique suggested by the instructor.

Step 5 – [3 points]: Did the student successfully and clearly implement functionality to switch from the main filter effect to some other filter effects?

===========================
**Further development**
===========================

- Implemented a JS switch to switch between filters. It switches the filters on key press (1,2,3, 4, 5).
- When the mouse is clicked on the left image around that point radial blur is applied on the right side of the image.
