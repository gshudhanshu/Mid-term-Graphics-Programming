3D Sine Wave

**Marking Rubric**

Step 1 - [2 points]: A grid of tiles of the right size, spread over the right area, has been produced.

Step 2 - [1 point]: Correct material and stroke is on display.

Step 3 - [2 points]: Structure is wavy like the demo at the top of the page.

Step 4 - [1 point]: Camera flies around like in the demo at the top of the page.

Step 5 - [2 points]: Confetti appear on top of the structure like in the demo, at random locations and random angles, but do not necessarily animate.

Step 6 - [1 point]: Confetti is falling downwards and is also rotating. When it reaches 0 on the y axis it resets to the top.

Step 7 - [3 points]: Has the student implemented ideas for further development?

**Ideas for further development:**
Customize the sketch by adding different materials that are affected by lights and add lights. Look at the p5.js documentation on lights and materials if needed. Can you add a different material only to the cubes and not the confetti? HINT: think back to push() and pop().

Create some p5.js sliders to make some of your variables for the cube grid dynamic, for example the height of the cubes or the speed of the sine wave or potentially resolution of the 2D noise.

**Further development**
=========================
I have implemented different materials and lights in the sketch. I have added multiple dropdowns to change the variables as follows:

- I have a dropdown menu to change the material of the cubes and confetti.
- I have added a slider to change the box size.
- I have added a slider to change the number of boxes.
- I have added sliders to change the min and max length of the sine wave.
- I have added a slider to change the confetti plane size.
- I have added a slider to change the camera speed.
- I have added a slider to change wave speed.
